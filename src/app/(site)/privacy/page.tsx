            <p className="mt-4">We have created this privacy statement to provide you with clear, simple, and complete information about how we process the personal data you give us or the data we may collect while you are browsing our website, how it may be transferred to third parties, and your rights and options to control your personal information and protect your privacy. Accordingly, we prepared this statement to inform you of the privacy principles that govern the Website and Services (the &quot;Privacy Policy&quot;).</p>
            <p className="mt-4">{siteConfig.siteName} reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting such changes on this page. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by means of a notice on the Website prior to the change becoming effective, and we may also try to notify you through email of the privacy changes, if necessary. Please check the revision date below to determine if this Privacy Policy has been modified since you last reviewed it.

            <h2 className="mt-8 text-2xl font-bold">A. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
            <h3 className="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold">How we collect your information</h3>
            <p className="mt-4">We may collect information regarding the use of our Website, especially with respect to your browsing (pages visited, links clicked, etc.). Some of this information may be collected using cookies placed in your web browser when you browse our website. The information that we request is and will be retained by us and used as described in this Privacy Policy. We do not request or intend to collect any “special categories of information” such as any information on health, race, religion, political opinions or philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences, or orientation.</p>
            <p className="mt-4">When you request a page from our Website, our servers log the information provided in the HTTP request header, JavaScript or similar technical tools, including the IP number, the time of the request, the URL of your request, and other information. We collect this information to make our Website function correctly and provide you the functionality that you see on the Website, as our servers use this information to deliver to you the pages on this Website. We also use this information to better understand how visitors use our Website and how we can better tune our Website, its contents, and functionality to meet your needs. However, this information is not associated with any personally identifiable information of persons browsing the Website.</p>
            <p className="mt-4">When you use the Website, {siteConfig.Name} Downloader or trusted third parties authorized by {siteConfig.siteName} may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer (also known as environmental variables) to facilitate your use of the Website and the Services enabled thereby. When you browse the Internet, your Internet browser (such as Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, or Microsoft Internet Explorer) automatically transmits some information to {siteConfig.siteName} every time you access content on one of our internet domains. Examples of such information include the URL of the particular Web page you visited, the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer you are using, or the browser version that you are using to access the Website. All of this information may be collected by {siteConfig.siteName} and used to help improve our offerings to you.</p>
            <p className="mt-4">We use cookies and other similar technologies to help provide our Services, to advertise to you, and to analyze how you use our Services and whether advertisements are being viewed. By continuing to use and navigate our sites, services, applications, tools, or messaging, you are agreeing to our use of cookies described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p className="mt-4">{siteConfig.siteName} does not track users over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore does use do not track (DNT) signals. However, some third-party sites may keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your web browser may allow you to set the DNT signal on your browser so that third parties (particularly advertisers) know you do not want to be tracked.</p>
            <p className="mt-4">Our Website also may contain links to other third-party websites. {siteConfig.siteName} is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any website you visit. {siteConfig.siteName} may make third-party applications available to you through the Website or Services. The information collected by {siteConfig.siteName} when you enable a third-party application is processed under this Privacy Policy. Information collected by the third-party application provider is governed by the provider&apos;s privacy policies.</p>
            <p className="mt-4">We may collect your information when you: (i) create a customer account on our applications, if applicable; (ii) contact our customer service or send requests for information to us; (iii) browse on the Internet using cookies or similar technology.</p>
            <p className="mt-4">{siteConfig.siteName} processes your information to:</p>
